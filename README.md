Here is a notebook of our fake news detection final project.
We have included the proposal, our work in the form of a notebook, our final report, and here a link to a video explaining our work: https://youtu.be/vVX_s3v-300

Additionally here is a link to our source dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k

Some tips to run this as you may run into issues with the dependencies and kaggle dataset. At the top we have different ways to run the code either by using the kaggle hub code lines or by downloading the data as a zip and importing the data in that way. We have to methods as DeSheng and I ran into issues, ultimately both chooising the most viable way ad alternating between commenting out what worked for us. Please reach out to us if there are any issues running the notebook. Aside from the top lines allvariables and dependencies are assigned the same once the data is read in.
